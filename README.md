# Coding challenges

## Some daily coding challenges to practice new skills/keep sharp

### List of challenges completed with short description:

- **binary_swap.js**: Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible (e.g., bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3are swapped, etc).
- **change.js**: Given a certain amount of currency in dollars, make change in American coinage. Indicate the number of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies returned.
- **change_two.js**: Same challenge as in change.js, but refactored to be more robust and object-oriented.
- **merge_arrays.js**: You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, and A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.
-  **number_palindrome.js**:  Figure out if a given number is a palindrome. You may not convert the number into a string. **(incomplete)**
- **replace_spaces.js**: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’
- **singly_linked.js**: Implement an algorithm to find the nth to last element of a singly linked list.
- **sort_anagram.js**: Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to each other. **(incomplete)**
- **sort_and_merge_arrays.js**: Combine sets of nested arrays with overlapping values. For example: [[1,3],[4,6],[5,8],[13,17],[11,14]] becomes: [[1,3],[4,8],[11,17]] **(incomplete)**
- **substrings.js**: Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (i e , “waterbottle” is a rotation of “erbottlewat”)
