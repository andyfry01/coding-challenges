# Coding challenges

## Some daily coding challenges to practice new skills/keep sharp
Some of these just fulfill the stipulations of the challenge and stop there, others I've expanded into mini-projects with functions for generating input data, testing, etc.  

### List of challenges completed with short description:

- **binary_swap.js**: Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible (e.g., bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3are swapped, etc).
- **change.js**: Given a certain amount of currency in dollars, make change in American coinage. Indicate the number of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies returned.
- **change_two.js**: Same challenge as in change.js, but refactored to be more robust and object-oriented.
- **fraction_reducer.js**: A fraction exists of a numerator (top part) and a denominator (bottom part) as you probably all know. Simplifying (or reducing) fractions means to make the fraction as simple as possible. Meaning that the denominator is a close to 1 as possible. You will be given a list with 2 numbers separator by a space. The first is the numerator, the second the denominator. Reduce the fractions.
- **hexadecimal_converter.js**: Write a function which converts hex number (given as a string) to decimal number. Account for both positive and negative hex values.
- **merge_arrays.js**: You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, and A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.
-  **number_palindrome.js**:  Figure out if a given number is a palindrome. You may not convert the number into a string. **(incomplete)**
- **replace_spaces.js**: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’
- **singly_linked.js**: Implement an algorithm to find the nth to last element of a singly linked list.
- **sort_anagram.js**: Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to each other. **(incomplete)**
- **sort_and_merge_arrays.js**: Combine sets of nested arrays with overlapping values. For example: [[1,3],[4,6],[5,8],[13,17],[11,14]] becomes: [[1,3],[4,8],[11,17]] **(incomplete)**
- **substrings.js**: Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (i e , “waterbottle” is a rotation of “erbottlewat”)
- **Yodle**:
By starting at the top of the triangle and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 27.

  ```
  5

  9  6

  4  6  8

  0  7  1  5

  ```

  I.e. 5 + 9 + 6 + 7 = 27.


  Write a program to find the maximum total from top to bottom in triangle.txt, a text file containing a triangle with 100 rows.
