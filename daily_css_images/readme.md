# Daily CSS Images
These are my attempts at the Daily CSS Images challenge, which is an email list that sends you 50 prompts, one every weekday, to code a particular image in pure CSS (like a bear or a pizza, for instance). You can read more about it here: [http://dailycssimages.com/](http://dailycssimages.com/).

Enjoy!
